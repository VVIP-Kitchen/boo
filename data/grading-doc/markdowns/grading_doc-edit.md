## Information about course grades:

S,A,B,C,D,E - Pass grade; U- Fail grade

In I grade - there are 3 types:

1. If you are absent for ET alone with all other assessment components completed (quizzes, OPPEs, project, weekly assignments) - grade will be pushed as I.

Options: You can register to take up ET exam alone in the subsequent term. OPPE and quizzes will not be scheduled for you. All other marks for Final course score will be taken from the previous run.

2. If you have failed in the OPPE but wrote the ET exam and crossed the cutoff for T as given in the course grading policy, grade = I\_OP.

You can register to do the OPPE alone whereby if the course has one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will be scheduled for you. You can attempt the OPPE alone. All other mark components of FInal course score will be taken from the previous run. ET and quizzes will not be scheduled for you.

3. If you have failed in the OPPE and absent for ET, then grade = I\_BOTH

You can register to ET and OPPEs alone. If the course has one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will be scheduled for you. You will attempt the ET and OPPEs. Quiz and GAA and other components will be taken from the previous run and not scheduled.

In all the above cases, you can also choose to Repeat the entire course and not just do the ET/OPPE alone if you want to reattempt all assessment components.

# Diploma Level courses

## Suggested pathway to register and study Diploma level courses:

1. Most aggressive pathway - completing in 4 terms \- ONLY IF YOU ARE DOING THIS AS FULL TIME AND NOTHING ELSE AND CAN SPEND 70 HRs PER WEEK MINIMUM
2. Comfortable pathway - 6 terms - 2 years : Suggested for students and working professionals doing this along with another degree or their job (40hrs/week)
3. Those from non technical backgrounds, new to programming or have busy schedules, recommended to take 6 or 7 terms for the 2 diplomas.
4. Same sequence of courses are suggested if you are taking only the Diploma in programming or Diploma in DS separately too.

Maximum number of terms to complete both Diplomas: 12

Even with a relaxed pathway, you should complete in a maximum of 7 or 8 terms.

The new rules for those entering Diploma Level from May 2024 onwards:

- Complete minimum of 3 courses and 1 project in every 3 terms, which means the

- slowest you can go is 3 courses and 1 project in 3 terms (1 year), 6 courses and 2 projects in 6 terms (2 years), 9 courses and 3 projects in 9 terms (3 years) and 12 courses and 4 projects in 12 terms (4 years).

- At the end of 3 terms, if you do not complete 3 courses and 1 project you will be given warning. At the end of 6/9/12 terms if you do not complete 6/9/12 courses and 2/3/4 projects, you will be removed from the program.

If you wish to do the Diploma in programming and Diploma in data science one after the other and not mix up the courses, here are the suggested pathways.

- If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail in this, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have to do it in the subsequent term.

We are NOT going to have 2 OPPEs going forward. It is going to be ONE OPPE based on weeks 1-9.

Students have to mandatorily attend the OPPE on the first date.

-  If you fail in this, you get a chance to reappear the next weekend. So you get 2 chances to attempt the exam.
- If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail in this, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have to do it in the subsequent term.
- If you are absent on December 8 2024, you DONT get another chance on December 15.

## Project Courses:

Project courses are now for 2 credits each - BDM, MLP, App Dev 1 and App Dev 2.

The Project courses are not part of CCC. The CCC is only for theory courses.

App Dev1 Theory is a co-requisite for App Dev 1 project.

App Dev1 project is a corequisite for App Dev2 Theory.

App Dev2 Theory is a corequisite for App Dev2 Project.

MLP course is a co-requisite for MLP project.

BDM course is a co-requisite for BDM project.

MLP: If you have completed MLP Theory course in MAY 2024 or SEP 2024 and complete MLP project in SEP 2024, we will evaluate your project for 105 marks and cap it to 100.

There will be fortnightly assessments configured in the MLP project course alone that you have to submit. We will be using this information to cross check your engagement in the course.

App dev 1 and 2: If you have completed Appdev1/Appdev2 Theory courses in May 2024 or SEP 2024 and complete the corresponding projects in SEP 2024, we will evaluate your project for 120 marks and cap it to 100.

BDM project will be evaluated only out of 100 marks for all students, irrespective of the term submitted in.

Each project has its own modalities and processes to be followed.

Please check your course announcements for the project timelines and make the submissions accordingly.

## Timelines (Appdev1, Appdev2 & MLP, BDM projects):

Here are the timelines for students doing projects in the SEP 2024 terms who will be entering Degree level in the Sep 2024 term. Without completing the 12 courses and 4 projects, you cannot start degree level courses from Jan 2025 onwards.

For entering the Degree level in Jan 2025, you have  to complete ALL projects and vivas by November 2024. \`

BDM project final submission has to be done and approved by October/November 2024 so that viva can be over in November/December 2024. Project grade for all the courses will be pushed on/before Dec 25th.

Very important:

Students who completed App dev1, App dev2, MLP and BDM in Sep 2021/Jan 2022 terms:

If you complete the 6 courses and 2 projects of any of the two Diploma, you will get the Diploma certificates. But your credits will not be 27 for this Diploma but 23 or 25 depending on how many of these courses were completed in these 2 terms. The projects done as part of the courses of Sep 2021/Jan 2022 will not get the 2 credits. So there is no issue with the Diploma level.

When you come to the BSc level, 114 credits are required to obtain the BSc certificate. Hence this deficit of 2/4/6/8 credits will have to be made up by taking more elective courses offered by the IITM BS program.

# Degree Level courses

Level of the course:

The first digit of the 4 digits given in the course code represents the level of the course. Eg: CT is CS1001 is a 1 level course.

Deep Learning CS3004 is a 3 level course.

Reinforcement Learning CS4002 is a 4 level course.

BSc level:

It is now mandatory that students have to complete both the core pairs and SPG in the BSc level. Credits = 20

All 8 credits can be earned from IITM BS courses or NPTEL (maximum upto 4 credits from Table 2) or if there is an option to credit campus courses (IITM or other institutes), that too can be done.

This will be implemented wef Sep 2023 for the batch that enters the degree level in Sep 2023.

BS level:

2 courses in the level 4 or higher should be mandatorily completed in each of the BP and BD categories.

Out of the remaining 12 credits, it is MANDATORY to earn 4 credits in the HS/MG category. HS/MG can come from inhouse electives or from NPTEL-Table 3.

Remaining credits are from any of the other in-house/campus electives or Apprenticeship electives.

Apprenticeship:

Apprenticeship is completely optional. Students can also complete the BS level by just doing only course work.

Recommendation on taking additional courses and learning more skills not taught directly in the program curriculum.

We are also collaborating with the Microsoft and AWS certification program team to offer their courses for our students at discounted rates. Would be good to complete some cloud certifications from this too when we offer it.

It is important you learn more on programming and data science outside of what the curriculum offers and strengthen your resume.
